"ADDIE Training Program. User training is an important aspect of product roll-out and adoption. A good training program engages, enables, and empowers your end-users to fully leverage the capabilities and benefits of using your product. This play provides guidelines and frameworks for identifying the end user's needed skills and providing the necessary training for each unique project using the ADDIE methodology. The ADDIE Model outlines five steps to instructional design: analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate. While these steps are linear and performed in order, they can be iterated upon throughout the software system's lifecycle. ADDIE is not the solution for every training program, but the framework aligns with Agile development processes."
"Affinity Mapping. Affinity mapping, also known as affinity diagramming, is a collaborative technique that helps teams organize and synthesize large amounts of information into meaningful, consumable, and actionable pieces. Affinity mapping involves two main steps: generating ideas and organizing those ideas into meaningful groups. The ideas or data that become the sticky notes used in affinity mapping can come from anywhere, such as ideation sessions, observations, facts from a research study, or thoughts and feedback from any collaborative exercise like retrospectives or process flow mapping. The organization of the sticky notes is about putting them into groups based on relevance, relationships, and connections."
"Agile estimation is the process of analyzing backlog items to provide a relative, approximate size (story points) done by a scrum team. These estimated story points, in combination with prioritization, are used to plan sprints and releases. Agile estimation is a team process and is consensus-based, requiring participation and input from the entire team."
"Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) is an agile software development methodology that focuses on an application's behavior from the end user's perspective. In contrast, Test-Driven Development (TDD) focuses on testing an application's functionality. TDD does not focus on how users interact with the application, so BDD evolved from TDD."
Card sorting is a research technique that asks participants to group a set of items into categories that make sense to them.
"Team members unobtrusively conduct an in-depth observation of participants at work in their natural environments, with their permission, and ask questions about their processes and experiences."
"A customer journey map (also called a user journey map) is a visual story of your customer’s journey through every touchpoint of your brand, product, or service. It highlights the customer’s activities, goals, and experiences in relation to the touchpoints, including what they are thinking and feeling through each stage of their journey, as well as what the application, service, or company is doing in response."
Definition of Done is a shared understanding from the team that defines what it means for a work item to be complete. It is a living document and iteratively updated by the team with the scrum master's guidance.
"Definition of Ready is a shared understanding from the team that defines what it means for a work item to be ready to be placed in an iteration. User stories and work items can be evaluated for meeting the DoR during refinement. It is a living document determined and iteratively updated by the team, with the scrum master's guidance. Accepting a story or work item into a sprint means that the team is confident that there is enough information to deliver the work and that the user story meets the INVEST matrix (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable). The Product Owners can use DoR when preparing for user stories for upcoming sprints. The team uses it as a checklist during refinement and sprint planning to make sure that the work item is complete enough to deliver within a sprint."
"Design kits are often known as a UI Kit or user interface kit and are often confused with design systems. While different, they do go hand-in-hand. A design system is much broader than a design kit. A design system relates to the code components, standards, guidelines and best practices, and much more. A design kit is a single file containing reusable components that designers use to build mockups or prototypes. It can stand alone without any relation to a more extensive design system or be used as a tech agnostic design system in some instances. Design kits are typically created with a vector-based user experience design tool like Sketch, XD or Figma. A good design kit should contain the app’s color palette, typography, grids, and icons. However, the bulk of the kit includes commonly used UI components such as alerts, buttons, form elements, alerts, tooltips, and even patterns and templates."
"In a professional context, a meeting is an assembly of two or more people by arrangement for discussion. Although many people dread having meetings, they are the cogs that make our organization work. The misconception is that meetings are a waste of time, despite the multiple benefits of having effective, well-planned meetings. The truth is, we’ve all experienced meetings that are disorganized, wasteful, and simply unproductive. We cannot avoid having meetings, but we can make them as efficient as possible to make them an effective communication and collaboration tool."
"Empathy mapping is a group exercise which helps teams visually represent and articulate what you know about a user - the person who uses your products. An empathy map is created from user research data. Its primary goal is to help a cross-functional team reach a shared and in-depth understanding of a user’s behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and contextual influences. Like user [personas](https://www.vstart.dev/plays/personas), an empathy map helps you better understand users. Empathy mapping is a tangible and living document that can be created and shared with users and stakeholders to create alignment while visually representing what the team knows about a user."
"Event Storming is a rapid and highly collaborative workshop used to explore complex business needs and domains. Event Storming comes from a software development approach known as Domain-Driven Design, a practice that connects software development to a business’s core model and concepts. Three types of Event Storming workshops can be used in different scenarios: Big Picture, Process Modeling, and Software Design - we’ll go into these scenarios in more detail below. A hallmark outcome of an Event Storming workshop is a comprehensive end-to-end flow and visualization of value streams denoted using a specific modeling language and format."
"Ideation is a creative process used to generate ideas that address a problem statement in a facilitated, judgment-free environment. The purpose of these sessions is to come up with as many ideas as possible from team members."
"The information architecture (IA) is the backbone of an application as it defines the overall structure. When laying out the IA, it’s easy to see how to make it navigable and accessible to the user. The key to great IA is to understand how your targeted users think and what problems they are trying to solve, and then present the information in a logical order that makes sense to them with this context. Site maps are hierarchical diagrams showing the structure of a website or application and are artifacts of information architecture."
"A good software development project requires internal immediate testing to enable quality delivery of the product. The team’s own Business Analyst (BA) or Quality Assurance (QA) engineer should be closely involved to verify that acceptance criteria are met before the product moves to the next stage of development. This play aims to help development teams set responsibilities and expectations around the manual acceptance criteria testing set up, tracking, and communication."
"Post Production Validation (PPV) is the validation of an application immediately following a code push to production. This can be done for major releases or minor releases, but ideally every time something changes in production there is an external validation of the changes that have been made."
"A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a version of a working product that allows the team to learn from and interact with their customer with the least amount of effort. MVP attends to the core customer needs first and as soon as possible. It helps to validate needs, reduce risk, and help the program’s course correct quickly, as needed. Rooted in concepts that emerged from the book “The Lean Startup” by Eric Ries, the core idea is to facilitate a better understanding of the customers’ needs and interests without committing or using a large number of resources or fully developing a product."
"Personas are fictional characters that represent actual user groups based on user research. They are created to differentiate between the distinct user groups that might use your product. The final persona artifact is a visual document that has different sections for demographic information, behaviors, goals, frustrations, motivations, and any other relevant data to that user group."
Prioritization is an essential activity of product and project management that applies basic economics principles to assign a value to backlog items and put them in order. The basic tenet of prioritization is to work off your backlog to gather a list of all the problems you want to solve and order the list based on value.
"A product backlog item is a work item or artifact on the product backlog that describes the requirement or task that needs to be completed to meet the business objectives. Product backlog items can include epics, features, stories, or bugs. This play contains definitions of different product backlog items and provides some guidelines to help create useful product backlog items. This play is not intended to be prescriptive or exhaustive; the team should ultimately do what works best for them to deliver the most value to the business and end-users."
"A Product Backlog is an ordered list of all the requirements needed for a specific product. This includes features, user stories, enhancements, and bug fixes, and is a live document that is always evolving and never considered complete. In SAFe, the product backlog is called the ‘Program Backlog’ and applies to a single Agile Release Train (ART). Product backlog management is the process where the product owner, in collaboration with others, adds, adjusts, refines, and prioritizes the backlog items."
Product backlog refinement (PFR) is a continuous review of the product backlog (dynamic body of information) to create a shared understanding of the functionality to be developed. This ensures that the top priority items in the backlog are ready for development in the next sprints.
"A product launch is a coordinated effort to bring a new product or feature to market. A major release is often referred to as a product launch. Unlike a release plan, a product launch ensures your product lands with the customer. It focuses on the customer and end-user communication necessary to excite customers and align and inform both internally and with the customer. You will also need to define success measures through KPI’s and associated metrics. Finally implementing tying in the strategy with your marketing efforts if applicable to your launch. Product launch planning consists of a planning document that details the tasks and timelines behind getting users to interact with a new feature or product. It also includes what happens after you bring a new product to market including understanding how well the product is accepted by users."
"Whether for a short-term technical challenge or a long-term client engagement, any project needs a strong start. That's where a well-planned and conducted kickoff meeting can effectively communicate the vision, objectives, and process. Kickoffs can be geared towards the only internal team or be comprehensive and include the client. This play focuses on internal kickoff meetings; however, there are also specific tips for kickoffs involving the client."
"A Research Readout is a summary of your research findings. A readout can happen after conducting user interviews, user testing, or even a design studio. The readout can occur in many different forms. Typically, the deliverable is a formal report ( Word Document) or presentation (PowerPoint or KeyNote). It can include graphs, charts, images, videos, and user quotes."
A Sprint Retrospective is a scrum team ceremony that occurs after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning. It is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to openly discuss what went well and what didn't in the previous sprint. The outcome is to create a plan for necessary actions and improvements to be enacted and during the next sprint.
"Scrum is an agile framework that focuses on continuous improvement and learning. A scrum team is typically composed of a Scrum Lead/Scrum Master, a Product Owner, and three to eight cross-functional, self-organizing individuals who work collaboratively to deliver the product increments. Each role is a peer to the others, and there’s no structural hierarchy. Scrum teams are flexible and adaptive, which allows them to respond quickly and efficiently to change."
"One of the challenges of beginning a new program or project is determining the most beneficial Agile Framework to manage and deliver your products. Programs that arbitrarily select a framework or are directed into a specific framework often encounter challenges managing their products and delivery. When selecting an Agile framework, several considerations are necessary, such as knowing your client, understanding their pre-existing delivery and customer landscape, and identifying their long-term delivery vision and Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Additionally, a plan to educate your Program and teams to ensure they operate within Agile-based concepts is essential."
"Objectives and milestones are both critical in a product development process. An objective is a quantifiable goal you want to achieve that seeks specific outcomes, and a milestone is a significant point of progress tied to analytics. Product objectives are defined by the milestones, which are time-bounded results tracked against objectives. These are often measured through quantifiable and qualitative metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs)."
Sprint zero is the initial sprint for a project that focuses on activities to help the team prepare for the upcoming sprint cadence.
"Task Analysis: A task analysis is the process of learning and understanding how users perform their tasks and achieve their intended goals, typically by observing them in action. This activity is about taking a very broad or high-level task and breaking it down into smaller subtasks and objectives that are then sequenced. Flow Diagrams: A flow diagram is a visual representation of all the steps within a specific process, system, or action. It is the sequenced version of the broken-down task because it visually lays out every step a user takes from the beginning of a task to the intended goal. Flow diagrams are one type of deliverable of a task analysis activity. There are two states of flow diagrams: As-Is: A visual representation of the current process as it is today. To-Be: A visual representation of how a process could look."
"Team onboarding is the process of introducing a new team member (whether recently hired or moving from another project) to the culture of your team. It is a time to set expectations on roles, responsibilities, and rules of engagement. In addition, it may involve walking through documentation and basic information about your project, demonstrating existing applications or work in progress, explaining the tools and artifacts that the team uses, and other activities that you deem necessary and relevant for the person onboarding to become a productive member of the team."
"Technical Challenges are a common requirement for modern proposals, especially in the government realm, where the candidate company/team is asked to “show, not tell.” Challenges can vary widely in scope and duration depending on the actual proposal requirements. This play outlines strategies and actions that are necessary for the preparation of the team. This play focuses on the “organization” of potential activities for the challenge. For information on the schedule and operations side of challenges, see “Technical Challenge Ops” play."
"Technical Challenges are a common requirement for modern proposals, especially in the government realm, where the candidate company/team is asked to “show, not tell.” Challenges can vary widely in scope and duration depending on the actual proposal requirements. This play outlines strategies and techniques that could be utilized during code challenges. To provide a more comprehensive cross-functional process, we will assume that the code challenge requires you to build a web application by applying Agile frameworks, DevSecOps, User-Centered Design, and Product Management principles. This play focuses on a generalized “schedule” of potential activities for the challenge. For information on the management and administration side of challenges, see [Technical Challenge Set Up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VldCFhmX0JY22-7LY-WrMP1SzbH2sSdMBfWM2N_NwmE/edit?usp=sharing) play."
Testing how easy a design is to use with a group of representative users. There are 2 parties involved in a usability test: the moderator or person facilitating the session and the participant or the person attempting to complete the tasks.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the phase of the software testing process that allows end-users (and stakeholders) to perform end-to-end testing on software to ensure that the application meets their business needs and expectations before the features are officially launched. It includes “real world” scenarios to ensure that the software is ready to be released. End users run through scenarios that mimic common tasks to ensure that the software that is being released will not impede their responsibilities.
"User interviews are semi-structured conversations with anyone interested in a project’s success, including users. Typically they are one-on-one sessions with a stakeholder or user to learn more about a topic."
"User stories are small, tangible requirements that can be used to communicate and summarize the functionality of the product. They contain a list of acceptance criteria that determine when the user story can be considered done. Larger user stories will be classified as Features and then Epics. Both will later be decomposed to fit into a single sprint."
"User story mapping (USM) is a collaborative exercise that helps agile development teams define work by visually mapping the user stories using the user’s journey as the guide. It is a user-centric approach focused on actual user needs. The mapping process creates a workflow that replicates the real user journey and helps identify gaps, prioritize actions, and brings clarity to the team and stakeholders. Visually viewing the stages and features helps create a clear picture of what ""must"" be delivered each iteration, from the MVP base functionalities to enhancements, nice to haves, and other activities."
The various models in which UX team roles can be organized in order to support the wider team's organizational structures and project setup.
UX roles describe the various parts a person plays in the design process. They range from generalists to specialists. UX roles may overlap in responsibilities and evolve with team structure and design process of an organization.
"A wireframe is a high level visual depiction of a product, application, or website. Wireframes allow you to plan the layout and interaction patterns without getting bogged down by trivial things like font type, text colors, and content. Wireframes can be confused with sketches because of the similarities they share, however, wireframes are actually the middle ground between a sketch and a mockup, which then leads to a prototype."
Working Agreements (WA) are a set of rules established by the team to make themselves more efficient and self-managing. These ground rules define how a team will work and interact with each other in order to achieve team goals and be most productive. WA’s are also referred to as Team Norms or Social Contract. These rules are revisited often and updated by the team as team dynamics and environment evolve.
